<p>I like the plot of it, the story was really nice. A big brother struggling to take care of his sister while being financially challenged, also going through his own trauma of witnessing his own younger brother getting kidnapped when he was just 12 years old. But the actors' lacked chemistry, Vanessa Character delivered 100%, So did Mike, but I dont know, some moments felt cringey or didnot belong to the scene. </p>

<p>This was okay to watch but really predicatable felt like rewatching years worth of christmas over and over again. It was a good movie but predictable and nothing unique about it. But the acting is really nice, felt warm. But i dont know , not my cup of tea. </p>

<p>Okay so this movie was really good. The acting was great, not predicatable, there were extremely gore scenes but not that gore, compared to the famous movie franchise "saw". It was a great movie all in all, i really enjoyed watching it, and yes thats about it. Hope you watch this if you are someone who enjoys horror and thriller. Highly recommend!</p>
